		<desc>In a bay near Aokata, Shinkamigoto has several large petroleum containers.  These containers are designed to provide Japan with an emergency supply of fuel in the event that current fuel trade becomes cut-off.  They hold enough fuel to satisfy Japan's current fuel consumption rate for a week.  These petroleum reserves are the largest and first of their kind in the world.
