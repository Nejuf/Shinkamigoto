SUPER SIMPLE CONTACT FORM MAKER
supersimple.org
v1.2
released 8/19/2010

Your download package contains 4 files.
contact.php is the entire script, including javascript, css, html and php.

for those who would like an easier way to incorporate any and all parts into an existing page,
the other 3 files contain the form handler, the javascript, and the html as independent files.

Using the complete file, or it's constiuent part files will work the same way. SO, use whichever
method you prefer.
