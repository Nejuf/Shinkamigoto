		<desc>Hamagurihama is one of the largest beaches on Nakadori Island.  This beach remains shallow far out into the water and is relatively calm.  During low tide, one can walk out onto the newly revealed plateau of the ocean bottom.

		During swim season, the beach is monitored with lifeguards and medics onsite.  There are showers and restrooms, as well as a covered area for bags, supplies, etc.  Behind the beach building is a food stand that sells drinks, snow cones, and udon.  Behind that is a small playground.  Paddle boats and kayaks can be rented at the beach for a fee.
