		<desc>Inside Arikawa's ferry terminal, there is a museum with a variety of artifacts.  There are displays of churches and shrines, festivals, ships, and other local creations.  The first thing one will see upon entering the terminal is likely the full size whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling.  Sometimes, films are shown inside the museum.
